# unsw-term

Totally not a tool I'm making because I didn't write down when I did things in my journal, so I need to figure out what week and term it was based off random dates for my statement of contribution.

## Usage

**Setup**

To setup the script run the following command.

```sh
source setup
```

It will install dependencies and add the script to your path so it can be run in any directory

**Running**

```sh
unsw-term <DD/MM>
```

**Example**:

```sh
$ unsw-term 20/4
Wed | Week 10 | Term 1
```

**Note**: The year is assumed to be the current year it is run in.
