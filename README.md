# unsw-term
Totally not a tool I'm making because I didn't write down when I did things, so I need to figure out what week and term it was based off random dates for my statement of contribution.

## Usage
**Setup**
```sh
# Set up virtual environment
python3 -m venv env

# Activate virtual environment
source env/bin/activate

# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Running**
```
python3 unsw-term <DD/MM>
```
**Example**:

```python3 unsw-term 20/4```

**Output**:
> Tue | Week 10 | Term 1


**Note**: The year is assumed to be the current year it is run in.
